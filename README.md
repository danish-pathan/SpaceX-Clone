# SpaceX-Clone
This is a SpaceX Clone inspired by the the real [SpaceX website](https://www.spacex.com/).

In this project I have recreated parts of the SpaceX website, cool animations, adding special features with code and used JavaScript to manipulate the DOM. You'll find familiar parts of the site, along with some cool animations and special things.

If you find any issues or want to suggest improvements, please create a new issue or pull request.

Note: This project is a clone and educational exercise, created for the purpose of learning web development concepts. It is not intended for commercial use or to infringe upon SpaceX's intellectual property. All rights for the original SpaceX website and its content belong to SpaceX.
